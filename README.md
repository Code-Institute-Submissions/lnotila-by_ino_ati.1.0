## Bugs and fixes

### bug 1-sign up
The sign up page would not load after a user filled in all the details. Pressing submit would cause an error because allauth was trying to send an email to the email that the user would fill in.

### Solved bugs
To fix this error i added " EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.console.EmailBackend' " to the back end.

## Unfixed bugs

None

This work is the original work of Inotila Nghaamwa, however the following resources were used to supplement:

### Code
I used similar coding approaches to that which was used for the i think and therefore I blog. Particularly the Post and comment method. I therefore added my own custom model in MailingList. In addition I used a similar timeout funciton to make the message alert timeout.
