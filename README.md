# by_ino_ati(Portfolio 4)

This project is for my final submission for my fifth milestone. The aim of the project is to code and deploy a responsive e-commerce website using Java Script, python+ django, HTML and CSS. 

## About by_ino_ati

Is a web application where users can view and interact with art by artist Inotila Nghaamwa (the owner of the page). 

The site owner is an artist, and would like to offer users a platform where they can view and interact with his art work by being able to like and comment on individual pictures. In addition the owner would like to be able to handle data at the back end and make post on to the page using the backend. Furthermore, the owner would like to also be able to communicate the latest art works to his users via email, so he want to give user the opportunity to sign up for a mailing list. The owner would like to keep adding features to the site and updating it to increase the way in which site users can engage with the content, the owner and each other.

The users are primarily art enthusiasts, art collectors, and other people in the artistic community. These user would like to easily navigate the application and be able to interact with the content and other users on the app. Furthermore, get feedback from the app when they perform an action. In addition user want to be able to clearly view the content in a manner that they are familiar with like on applications like Instagram.

3. Users will be able to make bids on art pieces
4. User will be able to like content from the grid view page to
5. The number of comments a post gets will also be displayed

## Testing

Throughout the design process I did user tests with 5 individuals. These Test were a set of tasks which had an acceptance criteria for the users to achieve in order to see whether; to generally see if all the project issues were completed, the app navigation was clear, the intention of the app was clear, whether all features of the app worked, and to achieve general feedback on the UI and UX. 

The scope: 
Users could- 
1. View the content of the app.
2. If they could interact (like and comment) with the content.
3. If they could perform CRUD functionalities.
4. If they could navigate the application.
5. If all the links worked and all the buttons fire correctly.
6. If they could sign up, and sign in and out of the site.

Site admin could
1. Manage site post
2. Create, Read, Update, delete post and other site contents
3. Create draft posts to complete later

Test Methodology:
All the tests performed were done manually. The users were sent a link with a list of instructions and they reported back their results.
 
### User test

According to the feedback my users gave me the navigation of the application was simple to understand and navigate, and furthermore the understood what the intention of the app was from the moment they landed on the home page. User were asked to sign up, like a post and comment on a post. Furthermore, they were tasked with editing and then deleting a post which they did successfully. The users said they enjoyed the app and that it was a very similar experience to social media which made it relatable but with less distraction.

I too did these manual test to ensure that the apps features works as expected. And below are the results:

### Admin test

![an image of the testing done on the app](static/images/data.png)
Figure 1: Admin panel

I created a super user to make post on the app and view the data from the backend (see Figure 1). And this all worked. All post on the app where upload via the admin panel and I could view users who signed up to the app and their comments. In addition, I could see if they joined the mailing list or not.

### Signup, sign-in and sign-out test

![an image of the testing done on the app](static/images/signup.png)
Figure 2: sign-up

![an image of the testing done on the app](static/images/signout.png)
Figure 3: sign-out

I created also logged in as a regular user ( Pokemon) in the front end to ensure that the post are rendering as expected (see Figure 2), that all the pages are displaying with no broken links, and that the UI looks as intended. The signup function works, I could sign in and out (see Figure 3) without any issues.

### Home page test
![an image of the testing done on the app](static/images/homepage.png)
Figure 4: Home page view

I started by testing that all the links in the navbar and the home page buttons work and lead to where they are intended and they did (see Figure 4). The logo will send you home, as will the home link in navbar. The ink, painting, and pencil links in the navbar and the homepage buttons all lead to their respective pages.

### Art page test
![an image of the testing done on the app](static/images/gridview.png)
Figure 5: Art page view for Paintings

![an image of the testing done on the app](static/images/gridview1.png)
Figure 6: Art page view for Ink

![an image of the testing done on the app](static/images/gridview2.png)
Figure 7: Art page view for Pencil

Using the account of the fake user I created I test to see if all the art view were displaying and that the images were rendering properly (see Figure 5, 6, & 7). All the images were rending properly. I did however discover that the like counter was displaying unwanted text when the user is not authenticated, so I had to fix that.

### Like, comment, edit, and delete test

![an image of the testing done on the app](static/images/comment.png)

Figure 10: liked post

![an image of the testing done on the app](static/images/delete.png)
Figure 11: deleted the comment

I tested that like, comment, edit and delete buttons all work by going to the page of a single post and liked the post, created a comment, edited it and then deleted it. I created a test comment (see Figure 8). I then edited the text (see Figure 9).I liked the post, indicated by the black heart (see Figure 10). I then deleted the comment I edited earlier(see Figure 11).All of these buttons redirected me to the right page and executed exactly what I expected them to do in terms of CRUD functionality.

### Mailing list test
![an image of the testing done on the app](static/images/maillist2.png)
Figure 12: Mail list option just below the buttons (ink, paintings and pencil)

![an image of the testing done on the app](static/images/maillist.png)
Figure 13: Mail list option just below the buttons (ink, paintings and pencil) with a success message below the nav bar

For the mailing list I created a fake user namee Max. Max was able to join the mail list by clicking the join option and then the submit button (see Figure 12). After joining, Max was notified about this success (see Figure 13). From this test I could conclude that all the button in this form work as expected.

### Accessibility and performance test
![an image of the validators that the app was run through](static/images/lighthouse.png)
Figure 14: Lighthouse report

This app also meets the accessibility requirements of lighthouse in devtools. I ran it through light house and it got above 90% for all the criteria (see Figure 14).

## Wireframes and mock-ups

### Entity relationship diagram

I created this entity relationship diagram to guide me in creating my data structure in the models.

![an image of the mock-ups done during the design process](static/images/entityrelationshipdiagram.jpg)

### Wireframes
I designed a high fidelity prototype for my wireframes Figma. This prototype has most of the fuctionality of that will be seen in the live site. However, during the developement of the live site I found certain pages required a different design either to the ones seen in the prototype. Furthermore, certain features in the prototype may be implimented in future releases. The prototype is availabe for testing here:  [Prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/ovBwxM0RloJGWQoZdNKPAg/%40by_ino_ati?node-id=2%3A4&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=2%3A4)

## Bugs and fixes

### bug 1-sign up
The sign up page would not load after a user filled in all the details. Pressing submit would cause an error because allauth was trying to send an email to the email that the user would fill in.

### Solved bugs
To fix this error i added " EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.console.EmailBackend' " to the back end.

## Unfixed bugs

None

## Deployment

The live deployed application can be found at [by-ino-ati](https://by-ino-ati.herokuapp.com/).

### Heroku Deployment

This project uses [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com), a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.

Deployment steps are as follows, after account setup:

- Select *New* in the top-right corner of your Heroku Dashboard, and select *Create new app* from the dropdown menu.
- Your app name must be unique, and then choose a region closest to you (EU or USA), and finally, select *Create App*.
- From the new app *Settings*, click *Reveal Config Vars*, and set the following key/value pairs:
  - `CLOUDINARY_URL` (insert your own Cloudinary API key here)
  - `DATABASE_URL` (this comes from the **Resources** tab, you can get your own Postgres Database using the Free Hobby Tier)
  - `SECRET_KEY` (this can be any random secret key)

Heroku needs two additional files in order to deploy properly.
- requirements.txt
- Procfile

You can install this project's requirements (where applicable) using: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`. If you have your own packages that have been installed, then the requirements file needs updated using: `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`

The Procfile can be created with the following command: `echo web: gunicorn byinoati.wsgi > Procfile`

For Heroku deployment, follow these steps to connect your GitHub repository to the newly created app:

Either:
- Select "Automatic Deployment" from the Heroku app.

Or:
- In the Terminal/CLI, connect to Heroku using this command: `heroku login -i`
- Set the remote for Heroku: `heroku git:remote -a <app_name>` (replace app_name with your app, without the angle-brackets)
- After performing the standard Git `add`, `commit`, and `push` to GitHub, you can now type: `git push heroku main`

The frontend terminal should now be connected and deployed to Heroku.

### Local Deployment

*Gitpod* IDE was used to write the code for this project.

To make a local copy of this repository, you can clone the project by typing the follow into your IDE terminal:
- `git clone https://github.com/Inotila/by_ino_ati.git`

## Credits/Reference 
This work is the original work of Inotila Nghaamwa, however the following resources were used to supplement:

### Code
I used similar coding approaches to that which was used for the "I think and therefore I blog" project. Particularly the Post and comment method. I therefore added my own custom model in MailingList. In addition I used a similar timeout function to make the message alert timeout.
